# How you can tell if an emerging web technology is just a fad

Here's a fun game:

- Think of a food.
- Append ".js" to the food name and Google it.

I searched for *Cupcake.js*, *Banana.js* and *Meatballs.js*. Guess what? They're all JavaScript frameworks. Rest assured there's even a [Spaghetti.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spaghetti) to go along with your meatballs.

What do spaghetti and meatballs tell us about the state of front-end development? For one thing, the industry evolves at a blistering pace. That part won't surprise you. More importantly, the rabbit-like proliferation of frameworks illustrates why *you shouldn't take every change seriously*.

>Successful front-end engineers have one thing in common: they say "No" to almost everything.

This might sound sacrilegious; the web dev. community worships innovation and demands continuing education. But I don't mean "say no to learning." By all means, explore and tinker. Build a game in WebGL. Create apps with Angular, React and Ember to see which one floats your boat. Saying "No" is essential only when you and your team must *invest* in the tech.

Of course, knowing when to invest is the million-dollar question. I've made some costly mistakes in the past — like using a trendy yet bloated library for a performance-critical investing app. It was like deploying a sumo wrestler to a track meet.

These days my criteria for "No" are simple. I ask myself two questions:

> 1. Will it make customers happier?
2. Will it generate value for shareholders?

That's it.

If a technology doesn't answer one or both of these questions, I say "no." The first question takes precedence because customer relationships are more valuable than money.

You might be thinking:

> Wait a minute...That's not my job. The end-user doesn't care about my tech stack.

I'll put it this way: I don't care what brand of diesel engine goes into a bus, but I care about the experience of getting to work in the morning. Likewise, customers care about speed, aesthetics and overall usability. 

Component-based design is a good example of an implementation detail that trickles down into customer benefits. In my experience, React or Polymer components enable teams to reuse menus, buttons and other core UI elements to ship products faster. They facilitate a more cohesive look and feel, too.

I used to think my tech-stack decisions ran parallel to the customer experience and that they mainly impacted other developers. I still fall for silly trends occasionally, but I've learned to treat the end user's happiness as a litmus test.

That said, I'm still tempted to declare *Spaghetti* and *Meatballs* as dependencies just for fun.
